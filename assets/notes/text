    Fred's Roadtrip Storyteller is an app on your mobile device that talks to you about local history while you are traveling. It brings into focus, people and events that you might never have known about as you travel on vacation, commute to work or run errands around town.

    Fred's Roadtrip Storyteller acknowledges the hard work of thousands of dedicated volunteers who have documented, established and maintained the thousands of historical markers that chronicle that local history.

    Fred's Roadtrip Storyteller does all this with a click of a button, without any pre-planning by you. You simply start the program as you start your journey and the world of the past opens up to you.

    Fred's Roadtrip Storyteller reads aloud the title and content of historical markers that come within a user defined parameter; think of your car moving at 65 miles per hour as a bubble that ½ mile in diameter.

    Historical markers within that moving bubble are recorded and the words inscribed on those markers are read aloud to you – safely and hands free, without any distraction!
